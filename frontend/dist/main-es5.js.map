class=\"text-white-80 mb-4\">\n                    Our most dominant consumer software protocols are predominantly remote and asynchronous, and this property is ingrained in the way we think about the internet. From a broader historical sense, the internet is a natural culmination of the evolution of electronic communication which has continually eroded the obstacle of distance. This raw capacity is very attractive, and the protocols that leverage this extraordinary power will always be useful. <br/><br/>\n\n                    The remote and asynchronous property was also sensible, even necessary, given the hardware constraints within which many of our most dominant protocols were developed. Consider that email, social media, and search all emerged in the mainframe or desktop era when people accessed the internet at physical destinations specifically outfitted with the necessary technical apparatus. Such conditions implied intermittent access from isolated locations. As such, remote and asynchronous properties were necessary to create user experiences that matched this mode of consumption. <br/><br/>\n\n                    Perhaps the most effective way of achieving this was by delivering information that is contingent upon our identities or interests.  Since these artifacts of the individual remain constant, information based on these aspects remains relevant regardless of where or when we access it. Most of our legacy protocols, from email to social media, use this approach, and thus remain agnostic to the spatial or temporal dimensions in which we use them. In sum, there is a congruence between the dominant mode of consumption via desktop computing and the dominant software structures designed to extract maximum utility from this model.<br/><br/>\n\n                    Of course, the smartphone altered the mode of consumption dramatically. Instead of accessing the internet at intermittent times in isolated neutral settings, we are now connected continuously throughout our day, often in dynamic, public environments. But while the hardware and modes of consumption may have changed in a fundamental way, the dominant software protocols that we use to access our information haven’t changed as dramatically. Most of our communication by our mobile devices continues to be remote and asynchronous.<br/><br/>\n\n                    This is also totally sensible. The mobile mode of consumption doesn’t affect the core logic of delivering information contingent on identities and agnostic to the spatial orientation of the user. In fact, these aspects are enhanced in mobile, as the mobile phone’s unique ownership to one individual strengthens the element of personalization, and the portability of these devices takes full advantage of a protocol’s remote properties. From this point of view, the form factor of the phone seems like a simple value add, giving us the convenience of being able to engage with our status updates, emails, and our social media feeds anywhere anytime. For some, this is where the conversation ends. For Plazm, it begins. <br/><br/>\n\n                    Notice that while the portability of the phone works within the remote and asynchronous features, the remote and asynchronous features were not designed for the portability of the phone. It’s more accurate to say that the remote asynchronous properties of these software protocols neutralizes, rather than leverages the variability of circumstances inherent to mobile usage. It transposes a similar experience to the new form factor rather than creates a fundamentally new one. This situation recalls a recurring theme in the history of media and technology. As stated by Florent Crivello, <br/><br/>\n\n                    <span class=\"text-quote\">\n                        “In the beginning, new form factors fit existing workflows. Then, workflows fit the new form factors” \n                    </span><br/><br/>\n\n                    Of course, this leaves an opportunity to create new user experiences that leverage the unique properties of the new form factor, specifically the portability and constant access. More specifically, this implies shifting from a remote and asynchronous model to a local and contemporaneous one, and from organizing user experiences solely contingent on the user’s personal profile to ones that also account for the variable circumstances implied by the mobile mode of consumption. <br/><br/>\n\n                    So what are we missing when we continue to use the remote and asynchronous features in the mode of mobile consumption? What does a truly differentiated commitment to a local and contemporaneous approach look like? Why would it be useful? How do you design such a system? What distinguishes Plazm from other attempts at location-based social networks? <br/><br/>\n\n                    Over the course of the next few posts, I hope to elaborate on all these issues and more. By taking a principles first approach, I hope to explain how to make a protocol tailored to the new dimensionality of the mobile internet in a way yet unrealized in the mobile consumer landscape.\n\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>\n\n\n<section class=\"page-section\" id=\"services\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <h2 class=\"mt-0\">Social Media’s blind spot</h2>\n        <hr class=\"divider my-4\" align=\"left\"/>\n        <p class=\"text-muted mb-0\">\n            <span class=\"text-note\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned above, one of the key features of the Legacy information protocols is the degree to which the information they deliver are contingent on the user’s identity or personal interests, and how this contributes to the spatial and temporal agnosticism of these protocols. One of plazm’s core thesis is that while this agnosticism serves the remote and asynchronous model of communication, it is incompatible with the local and contemporaneous model. To illustrate this dynamic and explore its implications, social media likely represents the best case study and is discussed here. </span><br/><br/>\n            Social media, like search, requires the user’s existing knowledge as a necessary starting point, a conscious input to kick-start the flow of information delivered to the user. For search, the inputs are represented by the search terms, and the delivered content is matched by its relevance to these terms. For social media, the inputs are a group of accounts we specifically and deliberately subscribe to or follow, which are then sourced for content. <br/><br/>\n        </p>\n        <hr class=\"divider-light my-2\" align=\"left\" />\n        <div class=\"link-container\">\n            <sup>1</sup><a href=\"https://florentcrivello.com/index.php/2019/04/29/software-the-tough-tomato-principle-and-the-great-weirdening-of-the-world\">Software, the Tough Tomato Principle, and the Great Weirdening of the World</a><br/><br/>\n        </div>\n        <p class=\"text-muted mb-0\">\n            This shift from content to sources allows social media to deliver a greater range of information without having to consciously search for each discrete chunk of information that may emerge from the social graph naturally. As a result, we gain easy, instant access to a stream of novel information that we wouldn’t have had the awareness or the wherewithal to look up ourselves. Nevertheless, each of these sources must pass some threshold of psychological or mental or personal affinity for us to include them in our social graph in the first place. Naturally, these choices often reflect our interests, social connections, or other psycho-personal elements of the user. <br/><br/>\n\n            Furthermore, because the scope and shape of our personal affinity as represented by our interests, friends and personal tastes remain relatively constant, this model of relevance persists in practically any situation. For instance, if I’m interested in Cryptocurrency or the NBA and follow accounts that post about these subjects, each piece of content will remain at a similar level of relevance and interest. I bring my mind and personal affinity with me all the time, so my interest in these subjects are not dependent on where or when I am when I access that content. In other words, these protocols are agnostic to our circumstances, and form the basis for its remote and asynchronous communication model. It works incredibly well for the vast majority of our information and media consumption. But there is an exception.<br/><br/>\n\n            Information that is associated with or references a location represents a fundamental mismatch for the legacy remote and asynchronous models. Why? The relevance of local and contemporaneous content is more highly variable than information based upon conceptual or psychological affinity to the content creator. This variability is often correlated with proximity, so relevance is not agnostic to our physical circumstances, it actually depends on it. <br/><br/>\n\n            For instance, if I’m down the street thinking about what to eat, then information about the local cafe’s daily specials could be highly relevant and something I probably would like to know. But if I’m away on vacation, this information becomes very low relevance and low value. Compare this kind of information with content generated by an account that produces content relevant to my personal interests like the NBA. If I’m out of town or not travelling, the NBA account will remain more or less equally relevant to my life. Because our interest in this kind of information is so context-dependent, creators of local and contemporaneous information often do not pass the threshold for personal affinity and are thus never included in our social graphs in the first place. <br/><br/>\n\n            Furthermore, social media feeds are organized chronologically. As a result, local content is never delivered contextually along the dimension of proximity. So even if a user was following local content producers, there isn’t any guarantee to see this content in the situation where the information is useful.  We are then delivered locally relevant content that isn’t actually locally relevant, which simply degrades the overall relevance of our feeds. <br/><br/>\n\n            Consider a few examples of local content-the daily specials for a nearby restaurant, showtimes and reviews for a show that’s playing across the street, train arrival times at the nearest subway stations, a free yoga class at the local park. How would we find out or access this information? We either follow any account that generates this information such as the restaurant or theater itself, or accounts that publish movie reviews, or subway times, or free classes in the city. But then we would have to deal with these updates throughout the day in non-relevant contexts. Do we keep these accounts for the off-chance they tell us something when we want to hear from them? <br/><br/>\n\n            Alternatively, we could have to have a way to search for each piece a la carte. This method requires awareness that there’s something worthwhile to search for in the first place. But of course this is precisely social media’s function in the first place, to replace the need to search with a constant stream of information relevant to us. <br/><br/>\n\n            To put it simply, the same features that make these legacy protocols so useful in a remote and asynchronous context also preclude them from delivering locally relevant information in anything but a compromised, indirect, and inefficient way. The more local, the more incompatible this information. This structural gap represents an opportunity to forge a new system that can fill this need. How we build that vision is the subject of the next few posts.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</section>\n\n<!-- Analogue Analogues -->\n<section class=\"page-section bg-dark text-white\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <h2 class=\"mb-4\">Analogue Analogues</h2>\n        <hr class=\"divider-white my-4\" align=\"left\"/>\n        <p class=\"text-muted-white mb-0\">\n            <span class=\"text-note\">The remote and asynchronous communication models result in a flow of information wholly contingent on the identity and interests of the user. Thus, these systems are largely agnostic to the user’s location. In contrast, a local and more synchronous model would deliver a flow of information that depends on the variability of circumstances implied by mobile portability. How do we begin to imagine such a system? What does a truly differentiated, first-principles approach to a local contemporaneous model look like?</span><br/><br/>\n\n            A local and contemporaneous system must leverage the environment. And while we haven’t yet defined the specific protocol or system of such a network, we can easily analogize these characteristics to another system- our natural perceptions of our world through our senses, and the way we discover and react to stimuli localized in our immediate environments. <br/><br/>\n\n            It’s a simple but effective analogue that encourages us to examine our environment and see what information is literally available and communicated within them. For many parts of the world, that are sparsely populated or residential, there isn’t much.  But there are areas where this is not the case, specifically dense urban commercial areas. Here, there is a multitude of human-readable, semantic information in the form of signs, storefronts, and displays. Aside from the occasional advertising billboard, this information is almost always generated by brick and mortar businesses, designed for the visual consumption of local consumers. These businesses, shops, restaurants, cafes, venues, are not always alike in their communication needs, but share two core features that make them especially suited to a local and contemporaneous network - a physical public presence and the need to reach their consumers. <br/><br/>\n\n            By virtue of these properties, and their physical stationary presence in our environments, Plazm considers these content producers the fundamental layer of its network. It just so happens that digital content generated from brick and mortar businesses represents the archetypal problem previously described in Social Media’s Blind Spot. First, the relevance of this communication is much more highly variable than the typical social media account. We really only want to hear from these businesses in the specific case when we would like to engage with them, often when we are near them. Even if these accounts can be clever and fun, the communication is ultimately commercial and does not fit within the commonly used purposes of social updates, entertainment, news, etc. Thus, the vast majority of these accounts fail to achieve the level of general personal affinity required to be included in our feeds. This is all reflected empirically, as the majority of local businesses on these platforms maintain significant followings on these platforms. I’m sure you can also ask yourself and anyone else that may have a social media account, if they follow any brick and mortar businesses, and the answer is likely no. <br/><br/>\n\n            Given the inadequacy of the legacy models to accomodate a brick-and-mortar-businesses-to-consumer channel, you would be tempted to ask why it hasn’t been addressed before or if this is actually a problem that needs solving. While an aggregated business to consumer channel might seem sensible theoretically, the use case has been subsumed into existing services, specifically rating and review services like Yelp or Google Maps. <br/><br/>\n\n            There is more to say about these services in future posts, but for now, the important point is that such services still aren’t business to consumer channels. Review or local search sites are primarily based upon other consumer’s content i.e. reviews and ratings, so even if these services can link to the business, or even allow businesses to respond to the reviews, they are presenting them within the context of this user-generated content. Ultimately, there is a trade-off between gaining consumer awareness from these local review sites and maintaining a direct channel to those consumers. <br/><br/>\n\n            At this point, we can summarize one of Plazm’s core strategies - to unbundle the brick and mortar business to consumer content that is currently under-served by the current legacy system. Furthering the analogy of a business’ physical presence, the purpose and context of the business-to-consumer channel within Plazm’s protocol might best resemble mobile-consumable versions of the changeable displays and sandwich boards they use to augment their permanent signage.\n        </p>\n\n        <section class=\"my-5 mb-5\" class=\"portfolio\" id=\"portfolio\" style=\"margin: 40px 0\">\n            <div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n                <div class=\"row no-gutters\">\n                    <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-sm-6\">\n                        <a class=\"portfolio-box\" href=\"assets/portfolio/fullsize/1.jpg\">\n                            <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"assets/portfolio/thumbnails/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n                        </a>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-sm-6\">\n                        <a class=\"portfolio-box\" href=\"assets/portfolio/fullsize/2.jpg\">\n                            <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"assets/portfolio/thumbnails/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n                        </a>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-sm-6\">\n                        <a class=\"portfolio-box\" href=\"assets/portfolio/fullsize/3.jpg\">\n                            <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"assets/portfolio/thumbnails/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n                        </a>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-sm-6\">\n                        <a class=\"portfolio-box\" href=\"assets/portfolio/fullsize/4.jpg\">\n                            <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"assets/portfolio/thumbnails/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n                        </a>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-sm-6\">\n                        <a class=\"portfolio-box\" href=\"assets/portfolio/fullsize/5.jpg\">\n                            <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"assets/portfolio/thumbnails/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n                        </a>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-sm-6\">\n                        <a class=\"portfolio-box\" href=\"assets/portfolio/fullsize/6.jpg\">\n                            <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"assets/portfolio/thumbnails/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n                        </a>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-sm-6\">\n                        <a class=\"portfolio-box\" href=\"assets/portfolio/fullsize/7.jpg\">\n                            <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"assets/portfolio/thumbnails/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n                        </a>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-sm-6\">\n                        <a class=\"portfolio-box\" href=\"assets/portfolio/fullsize/8.jpg\">\n                            <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"assets/portfolio/thumbnails/8.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n                        </a>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\n        <p class=\"text-muted-white mb-0\">\n            These display elements are update-able to show a range of information, announcing sales, events, specials or just some clever statements or eye-catching visuals, and are designed specifically to engage passing customers. This is essentially the same purpose Plazm can augment and digitize. <br/><br/>\n\n            While the real-life analogue of sandwich boards, window displays, etc. work well enough for many businesses to use them often, the advantages of digitization would make it easier to update this information, expand the range of messaging and photos, and increase distribution of these messages not just to passers by but to anyone searching within the general area. From a consumer point of view, we can then imagine a mosaic of all these digital ‘sandwich boards’ updated at will by the businesses, searchable and browsable with a drag of their finger. The browsing experience switches from a vertical scroll along a chronological feed to a multi-directional drag in a spatial dimension that echoes the way we would wander and explore our city blocks. Engagement with a particular account can provide a digital doorway to an offline interaction, and a tool to assist the physical spaces of these businesses. Of course, the commercial nature of these interactions, and the various services that can further accommodate them, opens the door for monetization and future development.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</section>\n\n<!-- A Social Graph for Local Knowledge... -->\n<section class=\"page-section\" id=\"about\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row justify-content-center\">\n            <div class=\"col-lg-12\">\n                <h2 class=\"mt-0\">A Social Graph for Local Knowledge...</h2>\n                <hr class=\"divider my-4\" align=\"left\" />\n                <p class=\"text-muted mb-4\">\n                    <span class=\"text-note\">\n                        One of the core legacy services that Plazm aims to displace is the ratings and reviews space. Not only do they represent a major way users connect and find out about local businesses, but they also provide a value to\n                    </span><br/><br/>\n\n                    Local content in a very literal way can refer to information that is produced by content creators with a physical presence. We call this the fundamental layer. But there’s also another genre of local or environment-based content, which may be created by an individual or user or publication but refers to a place. We can call this the Annotative layer. In fact, the most popular location-based information networks such as Yelp or Google Maps use this layer as a way to distribute reviews and ratings by place. <br/><br/>\n\n                    These services not only validate the quality of these businesses with their rating and review systems, they also provide discoverability for local businesses in a mobile search context. In this sense they serve an established use case that already overlaps with the consumer’s need to reach the businesses directly, and they represent the nearest incumbents for a local and contemporaneous network that Plazm attempts to displace. Yet the challenge of competing with these services is exacerbated by these services’ many-years-long head start, large existing user bases, and huge accumulation of data that would seemingly confer a huge advantage. Still, examining these services reveals there are certain vulnerabilities and a way to innovate in this space that can provide the second component to Plazm’s local and contemporaneous network.<br/><br/>\n\n                    In some contexts such as page rank, the volume advantage of user data can translate into huge benefits to the user experience, where collective behavior can reveal the most useful and relevant connections. But while the inter-relevance of facts and ideas can more easily be entrusted to the wisdom of the crowd and the collective behavior of undifferentiated masses, the value of reviews and ratings are inherently much more subjective. Accordingly, there is a greater need to validate and trust someone’s taste or experience, and personalize our sources to match our preferences.<br/><br/>\n\n                    The universe of natural language search is also very open, complex, and abstract, which benefits from the emergent wisdom of the crowds approach towards truth. But for local search services, the relevant content mostly reduces down to a single rating and a series of largely undifferentiated reviews for each business. This information is much more crude and low-dimensional for the end user.  As a result, the benefits of scale are limited. Notice that a cumulative average rating moves less as the number of ratings increase. Similarly the 500th review for a restaurant doesn’t add as much value to the end user as the 5th. Even if there wasn’t diminishing marginal utility to this data, there’s only so many degrees of difference in this data that can result in meaningful differences. <br/><br/>\n\n                    The low dimensionality of the information also accounts for these services to develop a social graph for two main reasons. For one, on more open platforms, we can also rely on our existing social circle to share their views about practically anything, where the number of friends inclined to share reviews or ratings is much fewer. Perhaps more importantly, without the ability to produce content beyond the confines of reviews or ratings, individual content producers have less room to develop unique viewpoints. This reduces the space for users to find niche and long-tail content that can appeal to a focused community or sub-genre of content that offers a truly differentiated perspective. <br/><br/>\n\n                    So even though ratings there might be a greater need to validate and trust someone’s taste or experience, the obstacle of low-dimensionality and lack of differentiation make it unlikely that people actually develop a social graph for this specific kind of knowledge or perspective. Despite offering this functionality, we mostly dive into these apps without any regard for who has submitted the reviews or ratings we are reading. As already noticed, the era of the Yelp influencer has faded and already been usurped by traditional social media protocols.<sup>2</sup>  which offer differentiated content but nevertheless suffer from the contextual mismatch mentioned in Social Media’s Blind Spot. <br/><br/>\n\n                    The need for trustworthy and validated recommendations for places to go and things to do are also fulfilled by a parallel resource. Specifically, curation sites and blogs that make recommendations. They might have titles such as “The Top 10 Best Brunch Spots in NYC” or “Where to Find the Best Wings in Manhattan” or “Most Romantic Cocktail Bars” and can be published by a range of publishers from established media properties like Eater or Grub Street to lesser known bloggers. There are stand-alone apps (eg. The Infatuation) that offer this kind of content even using proximity-based delivery. These formats are popular enough and fill a role that yelp and 4 square often try to put together these lists themselves. The common element to all these resources is that each discrete piece of content within them refers to a specific place. Basically, they are a simple list of annotations based on certain themes, often delivered within a context of a map. <br/><br/>\n                </p>\n\n                <section class=\"my-5 mb-5\" class=\"portfolio\" id=\"portfolio2\">\n                    <div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n                        <div class=\"row no-gutters\">\n                            <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-sm-6\">\n                                <a class=\"portfolio-box\" href=\"assets/img/portfolio/fullsize/social_01.jpg\">\n                                    <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"assets/img/portfolio/thumbnails/social_01.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n                                </a>\n                            </div>\n                            <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-sm-6\">\n                                <a class=\"portfolio-box\" href=\"assets/img/portfolio/fullsize/social_02.jpg\">\n                                    <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"assets/img/portfolio/thumbnails/social_02.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n                                </a>\n                            </div>\n                            <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-sm-6\">\n                                <a class=\"portfolio-box\" href=\"assets/img/portfolio/fullsize/social_03.jpg\">\n                                    <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"assets/img/portfolio/thumbnails/social_03.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n                                </a>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n\n                <p class=\"text-muted mb-4\">\n                    There are quite a few advantages to this format.\n                </p>\n                <ul class=\"no-list text-muted\">\n                    <li>\n                        Publishers can leverage the popularity and strength of their brands, which allow users to validate and trust their information.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        Publishers can more freely communicate what they want without the burden of having to rate a place by some arbitrary and ill-defined metric.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        The openness of this content form can extend even further, beyond just reviews per se and fulfill specific niches of interest and penetrate the long-tail.

Of course, this content already exists on the web in the form of websites, blogs, social media feeds, etc. but as such, need to be accessed in separate, dis-aggregated channels. Like anything else on the web not on a single aggregated platform, they require some form of prior awareness to go and find these lists deliberately every time they are interested. And even if we follow these publishers on social media, we are still left with the same gap of intentionality and context, as there is no guarantee I will see a post from one of these publishers that is relevant to my search when I am curious about them. <br/><br/>\n\n                    As it stands, the user can choose between one of these options. On the one hand, they can choose a review site that allows them to browse the area with the convenience offered by a location-based interface, but get low-dimensional unvalidated information about the businesses . On the other hand, they can choose much more focused and specific, validated content, but only when they have the specific intentionality required to access them. The challenge becomes how to leverage the convenience of a social graph with a range of differentiated content within a local search context. <br/><br/>\n\n                    Plazm’s local knowledge graph is a solution. Content producers have the freedom to post any information as long as it references a place. Users get the ability to choose and validate these sources. This system achieves the core advantage of a social network. 1) the convenience of diving into a stream of information without having to specifically search for each piece of content. 2) the ability to configure and personalize the sources of information we trust and validate. And crucially, by organizing this content by its reference in a spatial dimension, this information is organized and delivered in the appropriate context for a local communication model.  Ultimately, any information that can be organized within a structure of a map could be submitted and displayed on the platform. To modularize this form of content, aggregate the sources on a single distribution platform, discoverable platform, and deliver the information in a spatial rather than chronological way represents a core element of Plazm’s unique service. <br/><br/>\n                </p>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>","import { Component, OnInit } from

interests. Since these don’t change very often, all the information that flows from this model remains relevant everywhere all the time. This is great for almost all our information needs. <br/><br/>\n  \n                          But there is an exception.<br/><br/>\n  \n                          Local and event-driven information represents a fundamental mismatch for this legacy model of social media. Unlike information based on our identity and interests, this kind of content also requires us to be physically nearby to be relevant and meaningful. Legacy social media, with its chronological feeds and social graphs, cannot solve this problem. <br/><br/>\n  \n                          Plazm can. <br/><br/>\n  \n                          By bringing together both local businesses and local knowledge experts, Plazm focuses on connecting mobile users to their environments in the most direct and intuitive way. <br/><br/>\n  \n                          The result is not only a community to share local knowledge, but a living, real-time map that helps us navigate the real world.  <br/><br/>\n  \n                          read more on the <a href=\"#\" class=\"link-blue\">blog.</a>\n                      </p>\n                  </div>\n              </div>\n          </div>\n      </div>\n  \n      <!-- Contact Us -->\n      <div class=\"section bg-dark\" id=\"contact\">\n          <div class=\"container\">\n              <h2 class=\"text-center mt-0 text-white service-title\">Say Hello.</h2>\n              <hr class=\"divider my-4\" />\n              <h5 class=\"text-muted-white\">questions? comments? we'd love to hear from you</h5>\n              <form>\n                  <div class=\"form-group\">\n                      <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" name=\"name\" id=\"nameInput\" placeholder=\"Full Name\">\n                  </div>\n                  <div class=\"form-group\">\n                      <input type=\"email\" class=\"form-control\" name=\"email\" id=\"emailInput\" placeholder=\"Email\">\n                  </div>\n                  <div class=\"form-group\">\n                      <textarea class=\"form-control\" name=\"message\" id=\"messageInput\" rows=\"5\" placeholder=\"Your Message\"></textarea>\n                  </div>\n                  <a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-xl js-scroll-trigger\" href=\"#about\">Send Email</a>\n              </form>\n          </div>\n      </div>\n  </div>","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\ndeclare var jQuery: any;\ndeclare function initPage(): any;\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-home',\n  templateUrl: './home.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./home.component.css']\n})\nexport class HomeComponent implements OnInit {\n  config: any;\n  fullpage_api: any;\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.config = {\n      licenseKey: 'YOUR LICENSE KEY HERE',\n      anchors: ['section_home', 'section_about', 'section_why', 'section_contact'],\n      menu: '#menu',\n      navigation: true,\n    };\n  }\n  \n  ngOnInit(): void {\n    (function ($) {\n      console.log(\"Test\");\n      initPage();\n    })(jQuery);\n  }\n\n  getRef(fullPageRef) {\n    this.fullpage_api = fullPageRef;\n  }\n}\n","// This file can be replaced during build by using the `fileReplacements` array.\n// `ng build --prod` replaces `environment.ts` with `environment.prod.ts`.\n// The list of file replacements can be found in `angular.json`.\n\nexport const environment = {\n  production: false\n};\n\n/*\n * For easier debugging in development mode, you can import the following file\n * to ignore zone related error stack frames such as `zone.run`, `zoneDelegate.invokeTask`.\n *\n * This import should be commented out in production mode because it will have a negative impact\n * on performance if an error is thrown.\n */\n// import 'zone.js/dist/zone-error';  // Included with Angular CLI.\n","import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';\nimport { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';\n\nimport { AppModule } from './app/app.module';\nimport { environment } from './environments/environment';\n\nif (environment.production) {\n  enableProdMode();\n}\n\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)\n  .catch(err => console.error(err));\n"]}
